# z-plugins

## What Are They?

They are Zinit extensions. Note the difference in the name from the Zinit –
the dash and the plural form.

## What Can They Do?

1. Add a new Zinit subcommand (i.e. the command that’s placed after the
   function `zinit …` when calling Zinit).

2. Add new ice-modifiers.

3. Register four type of hooks:

   1. `atclone` hook – run after cloning any plugin or downloading any
      snippet.

   2. `atpull` hook – run after pulling new commits (i.e. updating) for any
      plugin / snippet.

   3. `atinit` hook – run before loading any plugin / snippet, after it has
      been set-up (i.e. downloaded).

   4. `atload` hook – run after loading any plugin / snippet.

4. Register hooks for generating help text, shown by the `zinit help`
   subcommand.

## How To Code Them?

Below is an example body of an `atclone` hook (taken from
[**z-shell/z-a-submods**](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-submods) z-plugin). It
shows how to:

1. Obtain the arguments passed to the hook.

2. Use an ice modifier.

3. It also shows an useful snippet that will trim the whitespace in array
   elements.

4. Utilize the last hook argument – the plugin’s/snippet’s containing
   directory.

<!-- end list -->

```zsh
emulate -L zsh -o extendedglob -o warncreateglobal -o typesetsilent

[[ -z "${ZPLG_ICE[submods]}" ]] && return 0

# (1)
[[ "$1" = plugin ]] && \
    local type="$1" user="$2" plugin="$3" id_as="$4" dir="$5" || \
    local type="$1" url="$2" id_as="$3" dir="$4" # type: snippet

local -a mods parts
local mod

# (2)
mods=( ${(@s.;.)ZPLG_ICE[submods]} )
for mod in "${mods[@]}"; do
    parts=( "${(@s:->:)mod}" )
    # (3) Remove only leading and trailing whitespace
    parts=( "${parts[@]//((#s)[[:space:]]##|[[:space:]]##(#e))/}" )

    print "\nCloning submodule: ${parts[1]} to dir: ${parts[2]}"
    parts[1]="https://github.com/${parts[1]}"
    # (4) – the: -C "$dir"
    command git -C "$dir" clone --progress "${parts[1]}" "${parts[2]}"
done
```

The recommended method of creating a hook is to place its body into a file that
starts with a colon, and also a `zp-` prefix, e.g. `:zp-myproject-atclone-hook`
and then to mark it for autoloading via `autoload -Uz :zp-myproject-atclone-hook`. Then register the hook (presumably in the
`myproject.plugin.zsh` file) with the API call: `@zplg-register-z-plugin`:

```zsh
@zplg-register-z-plugin "myproject" hook:atclone \
  :zp-myproject-atclone-handler \
  :zp-myproject-atclone-help-handler \
  "submods''" # register a new ice-mod: submods''
```

The general syntax of the API call is:

```zsh
@zplg-register-z-plugin {project-name} \
  {hook: \
  {name-of-the-handler-function} \
  {name-of-the-HELP-handler-function} \
  "{ice-mod1}|{ice-mod2}|…" < hook-type >| subcommand: < new-subcommand-name > }
```

The last argument, i.e. the `|`-separated ice-list, is optional. That’s all\!
After this loading the plugin `myproject` will set up the new ice-mod `submods`
that will have syntax `submods'{user}/{plugin} –> {output-dir}; …'` and
will clone submodules when installing the original plugin or snippet\! Example
real-world use of the ice-mod:

```zsh
# Load the `zsh-autosuggestions' plugin via Prezto module: `autosuggestions'
zinit ice svn submods'zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions -> external'
zinit snippet PZT::modules/autosuggestions
```

Checkout the project which fully implements this idea,
[**z-shell/z-a-submods**](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-submods). It e.g. also
implements the `atpull` hook, i.e. supports automatic update of the submodules.
The `z-p-*` prefix is recommended for projects that are being z-plugins.

## Details

There are 2 or 3 subtypes for each of the hook:

1. `atinit` or `!atinit` – the `!` version is ran before the `atinit`
   **ice-mod** (i.e. before `zinit ice atinit'echo this!'; …`), while
   the normal version runs after it.

2. `atload` or `!atload` – analogous to the `atinit` case: the `!` version runs
   before the `atload` **ice-mod** (while the normal version runs after it).

3. `atclone` or `!atclone` – analogous to the `atinit` and `atload` cases.

4. `atpull`, `!atpull` or `%atpull` – the first two are being ran **only when
   there are new commits to be downloaded** during the update. The `%` version
   is being **always** run, regardless if the update will pull any actual
   commits or not, and it is being ran **after** the `atpull` **ice-mod**.
