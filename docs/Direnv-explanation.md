The project [**direnv/direnv**](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) registers
itself in Zshell to modify environment on directory change. This registration is
most often done by `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"` added to zshrc.

Drawback of this standard procedure is that `direnv` binary is ran on every
shell startup and significantly slows it down. Zinit allows to solve this in
following way:

```zsh
zinit as"program" make'!' atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' \
    atpull'%atclone' pick"direnv" src"zhook.zsh" for \
        direnv/direnv
```

- `make'!'` – compile `direnv` (it's written in Go lang); the exclamation mark
  means: run the `make` first, before `atclone` and `atpull` hooks,
- `atclone'…'` – initially (right after installing the plugin) generate the
  registration code and save it to `zhook.zsh` (instead of passing to `eval`),
- `atpull'%atclone'` – regenerate the registration code also on update
  (`atclone''` runs on _installation_ while `atpull` runs on _update_ of the
  plugin),
- `src"zhook.zsh"` – load (`source`) the generated registration code,
- `pick"direnv"` – ensure `+x` permission on the binary,
- `as"program"` – the plugin is a program, there's no main file to source.

This way registration code is generated once every installation and update, to then be simply sourced without running `direnv`.

The project is also available as binary Github release. This distribution can be installed by:

```zsh
zinit from"gh-r" as"program" mv"direnv* -> direnv" \
    atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' atpull'%atclone' \
    pick"direnv" src="zhook.zsh" for \
        direnv/direnv
```

- `from"gh-r"` – install from Github **releases**,
- `mv"…"` – after installation, rename `direnv.linux-386` or similar file to
  `direnv`,
- `atclone'…'`, `atpull'…'` – as in previous example,
- `pick"direnv"` – as in previous example,
- `as"program"` – as in previous example.
