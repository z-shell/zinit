## Using Turbo mode and for-syntax

```zsh
# A.
setopt promptsubst

# B.
zinit wait lucid for \
        OMZL::git.zsh \
  atload"unalias grv" \
        OMZP::git

PS1="READY >" # provide a simple prompt till the theme loads

# C.
zinit wait'!' lucid for \
    OMZL::prompt_info_functions.zsh \
    OMZT::gnzh

# D.
zinit wait lucid for \
  atinit"zicompinit; zicdreplay"  \
        z-shell/fast-syntax-highlighting \
      OMZP::colored-man-pages \
  as"completion" \
        OMZP::docker/_docker
```

**A** - Most themes use this option.

**B** - OMZ themes use this library and some other use also the plugin. It
provides many aliases – `atload''` shows how to disable some of them (e.g.: to
use program `rgburke/grv`).

**C** - Set OMZ theme. Loaded separately because the theme needs the `!` passed
to the `wait` ice to reset the prompt after loading the snippet in Turbo.

**D** - Some plugins: a) syntax-highlighting, loaded possibly early for a
better user experience), b) example functional plugin, c) Docker
completion.

Above setup loads everything after prompt, because of preceding `wait` ice. That
is called **Turbo mode**, it shortens Zsh startup time by <u>50%-80%</u>, so
e.g. instead of 200 ms, it'll be getting your shell started up after **40 ms**
(!).

It is using the for-syntax, which is a recent addition to Zinit and it's
described in detail [on this page](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/For-Syntax/).

## Without using Turbo and for-syntax

The same setup using the classic syntax and without Turbo mode (prompt will be
initially set like in typical, normal setup – **you can remove `wait` only from
the theme plugin** and its dependencies to have the same effect while still
using Turbo for everything remaining):

```zsh
# A.
setopt promptsubst

# B.
zinit snippet OMZL::git.zsh

# C.
zinit ice atload"unalias grv"
zinit snippet OMZP::git

# D.
zinit for OMZL::prompt_info_functions.zsh OMZT::gnzh

# E.
zinit snippet OMZP::colored-man-pages

# F.
zinit ice as"completion"
zinit snippet OMZP::docker/_docker

# G.
zinit ice atinit"zicompinit; zicdreplay"
zinit light z-shell/fast-syntax-highlighting
```

In general, Turbo can be optionally enabled only for a subset of plugins or for
all plugins. It needs Zsh \>= 5.3.
