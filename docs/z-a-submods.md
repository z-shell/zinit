## Introduction

An annex (i.e. an extension for Zinit – [more information](../Annexes/))
that allows Zinit to clone additional submodules when installing a plugin or
snippet. The submodules are then automatically updated on the `zinit update …`
command.

This annex adds `submods''` ice to Zinit which has the following syntax:

```zsh
submods'{user}/{plugin} -> {output directory}; …'
```

An example command utilizing the annex and its ice:

```zsh
# Load zsh-autosuggestions plugin via Prezto module: autosuggestions
zinit ice svn submods'zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions -> external'
zinit snippet PZT::modules/autosuggestions
```

## Installation

Simply load as a plugin. The following command will install the annex within
Zinit:

```zsh
zinit light z-shell/z-a-submods
```

After executing this command you can then use the `submods''` ice. The command
should be placed in `~/.zshrc`.
