- `load''` – condition that when fulfilled will cause plugin to be loaded,
- `unload''` – as above, but will unload plugin,
- note that plugins are loaded with <code>zinit load </code>, not `zinit
   light`, to track what plugin does, to be able to unload it,
- `atload'!…'` – run the `precmd` hooks to make the prompts fully initialized
   when loaded in the middle of the prompt (`precmd` hooks are being normally
   run before each **new** prompt); exclamation mark causes the effects of the
   functions to be tracked, to allow better unloading,
- conditions are checked every second,
- you can use conditions like `![[ $PWD == *github* ]]` to change prompt after
   changing directory to `*github*`,
- the exclamation mark `![[ … ]]` causes prompt to be reset after loading or
   unloading the plugin,
- `pick'/dev/null'` – disable sourcing of the default-found file,
- `multisrc''` – source multiple files,
- `lucid` – don't show the under-prompt message that says e.g.: `Loaded
   geometry-zsh/geometry`,
- `nocd` – don't cd into the plugin's directory when executing the `atload''`
   ice – it could make the path that's displayed by the theme to point to that
   directory.
