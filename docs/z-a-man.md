## Introduction

A Zinit [extension](../Annexes/) that automatically generates:

- man pages for all plugins and snippets (out of plugin README.md files by
  using [ronn](https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn) converter),
- code-documentation manpages (by using
  [zshelldoc](https://github.com/z-shell/zshelldoc) project).

Man extension is being activated at clone of a plugin and also at update of it
and it then generates the manpages. To view them there's a `zman` command:

```zsh
# View README.md manpage in the terminal
zman z-a-man
# View the code documentation (via the full plugin name, as demonstrated)
zman -c z-shell/z-a-man
```
