## .zinit-register-plugin

```text
Adds the plugin to ZINIT_REGISTERED_PLUGINS array and to the
zsh_loaded_plugins array (managed according to the plugin standard:
http://zdharma.org/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html)

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).

## :zinit-reload-and-run

```text
Marks given function ($3) for autoloading, and executes it triggering the
load. $1 is the fpath dedicated to the function, $2 are autoload options.
This function replaces "autoload -X", because using that on older Zsh
versions causes problems with traps.

So basically one creates function stub that calls :zinit-reload-and-run()
instead of "autoload -X".

$1 - FPATH dedicated to function
$2 - autoload options
$3 - function name (one that needs autoloading)

Author: Bart Schaefer

$3 - type: plugin, snippet, service plugin, service snippet

Uses feature(s): _eval_, _source_, _zle_, _zpty_

Called by:

```text
@zinit-scheduler
```

## @zinit-scheduler

```text
Searches for timeout tasks, executes them. There's an array of tasks
waiting for execution, this scheduler manages them, detects which ones
should be run at current moment, decides to remove (or not) them from
the array after execution.

$1 - if "following", then it is non-first (second and more)
invocation of the scheduler; this results in chain of `sched'
invocations that results in repetitive @zinit-scheduler activity

if "burst", then all tasks are marked timeout and executed one
by one; this is handy if e.g. a docker image starts up and
needs to install all turbo-mode plugins without any hesitation
(delay), i.e. "burst" allows to run package installations from
script, not from prompt
```
