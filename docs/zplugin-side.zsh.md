## .zinit-first

```text
Finds the main file of plugin. There are multiple file name
formats, they are ordered in order starting from more correct
ones, and matched. .zinit-load-plugin() has similar code parts
and doesn't call .zinit-first() – for performance. Obscure matching
is done in .zinit-find-other-matches, here and in .zinit-load().
Obscure = non-standard main-file naming convention.

$1 - plugin spec (4 formats: user---plugin, user/plugin, user, plugin)
$2 - plugin (only when $1 - i.e. user - given)
