<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>A Zsh-Zinit annex (i.e. an extension) that provides functionality, which
allows to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run programs and scripts without adding anything to <code>$PATH</code>,</li>
<li>Install and run Ruby <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems">gems</a> and
   <a href="https://github.com/npm/cli">Node</a> modules from within a local directory
   with
   <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-environment">\$GEM_HOME</a>
   and
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders">\$NODE_PATH</a>
   automatically set,</li>
<li>Run programs, scripts and functions with automatic <code>cd</code> into the plugin
   or snippet directory, plus also with automatic standard output
   &amp; standard error redirecting.</li>
<li>Source scripts through an automatically created function with the above
   <code>$GEM_HOME</code>, <code>$NODE_PATH</code> and <code>cd</code> features available,</li>
<li>Create the so called <code>shims</code> known from
   <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">rbenv</a> – the same feature as the first
   item of this enumaration – of running a program without adding anything
   to <code>$PATH</code> with all of the above features, however through an automatic
   <strong>script</strong> created in <code>$ZPFX/bin</code>, not a <strong>function</strong> (the first item
   uses a function-based mechanism),</li>
<li>Automatic updates of Ruby gems and Node modules during regular plugin and
   snippet updates with <code>zinit update …</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Simply load like a regular plugin, i.e.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit light z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node
</code></pre>
<p>After executing this command you can then use the dl'' and patch'' ice-mods.</p>
<h2 id="how_it_works_birds-eye_view">How it works – bird's-eye view<a class="headerlink" href="#how_it_works_birds-eye_view" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Below is a diagram explaining the major feature – exposing a binary program
or script through a Zsh function of the same name:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node/main/images/diag.png" /></p>
<p>This way there is no need to add anything to <code>$PATH</code> – <code>z-a-bin-gem-node</code>
will automatically create a function that will wrap the binary and provide it
on the command line like if it was being placed in the <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<p>Also, like mentioned in the enumeration, the function can automatically
export <code>$GEM_HOME</code>, <code>$NODE_PATH</code> shell variables and also automatically cd
into the plugin or snippet directory right before executing the binary and
then cd back to the original directory after the execution is finished.</p>
<p>Also, like already mentioned, instead of the function an automatically
created script – so called <code>shim</code> – can be used for the same purpose and with
the same functionality.</p>
<h2 id="how_it_works_in_detail">How it works, in detail<a class="headerlink" href="#how_it_works_in_detail" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Suppose that you would want to install <code>junegunn/fzf-bin</code> plugin from GitHub
Releases, which contains only single file – the <code>fzf</code> binary for the selected
architecture. It is possible to do it in the standard way – by adding the
plugin's directory to the <code>$PATH</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit ice as&quot;command&quot; from&quot;github-rel&quot;
zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
</code></pre>
<p>After this command, the <code>$PATH</code> variable will contain e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% print $PATH
/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
</code></pre>
<p>For many such programs loaded as plugins the PATH can become quite cluttered.
I've had 26 entries before switching to <code>z-a-bin-gem-node</code>. To solve this,
load with use of <code>fbin''</code> ice provided and handled by <code>z-a-bin-gem-node</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit ice from&quot;gh-r&quot; fbin&quot;fzf&quot;
zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>$PATH</code> will remain unchanged and an <code>fzf</code> function will be created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% which fzf
fzf() {
  local bindir=&quot;/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin&quot;
  &quot;$bindir&quot;/&quot;fzf&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running the function will forward the call to the program accessed through
an embedded path to it. Thus, no <code>$PATH</code> changes are needed!</p>
<h2 id="the_ice_modifiers_provided_by_the_annex">The Ice Modifiers Provided By The Annex<a class="headerlink" href="#the_ice_modifiers_provided_by_the_annex" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are 7 ice-modifiers provided and handled by the annex. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>fbin''</code> – creates functions for binaries and scripts,</li>
<li><code>sbin''</code> – creates <code>shims</code> for binaries and scripts,</li>
<li><code>gem''</code> – installs and updates gems + creates functions for gems'
   binaries,</li>
<li><code>node''</code> – installs and updates node_modules + creates functions for
   binaries of the modules,</li>
<li><code>fmod''</code> – creates wrapping functions for other functions,</li>
<li><code>fsrc''</code> – creates functions that source given scripts,</li>
<li><code>ferc''</code> – the same as <code>fsrc''</code>, but using an alternate script-loading
   method.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The ice-modifiers in detail:</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="1_fbingncneopath-to-binary_-_name-of-the-function">1. <strong><code>fbin'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-binary}[ -&gt; {name-of-the-function}]; …'</code></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#1_fbingncneopath-to-binary_-_name-of-the-function" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Creates a wrapper function of the name the same as the last segment of the
path or as <code>{name-of-the-function}</code>. The optional preceding flags mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>g</code> – set <code>$GEM_HOME</code> variable,</li>
<li><code>n</code> – set <code>$NODE_PATH</code> variable,</li>
<li><code>c</code> – cd to the plugin's directory before running the function and then
  cd back after it has been run,</li>
<li><code>N</code> – append <code>&amp;&gt;/dev/null</code> to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect both
  standard output and standard error to <code>/dev/null</code>,</li>
<li><code>E</code> – append <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect
  standard error to <code>/dev/null</code>,</li>
<li><code>O</code> – append <code>&gt;/dev/null</code> to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect
  standard output to <code>/dev/null</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% zinit ice from&quot;gh-r&quot; fbin&quot;g:fzf -&gt; myfzf&quot;
% zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
% which myfzf
myfzf() {
  local bindir=&quot;/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin&quot;
  local -x GEM_HOME=&quot;/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin&quot;
  &quot;$bindir&quot;/&quot;fzf&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h1 id="2_gemgem-name">2. <strong><code>gem'{gem-name}; …'</code></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#2_gemgem-name" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<h1 id="gempath-to-binary_-_gem-name_-_name-of-the-function"><strong><code>gem'[{path-to-binary} &lt;-] !{gem-name} [-&gt; {name-of-the-function}]; …'</code></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#gempath-to-binary_-_gem-name_-_name-of-the-function" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Installs the gem of name <code>{gem-name}</code> with <code>$GEM_HOME</code> set to the plugin's or
snippet's directory. In other words, the gem and its dependencies will be
installed locally in that directory.</p>
<p>In the second form it also creates a wrapper function identical to the one
created with <code>fbin''</code> ice.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% zinit ice gem'!asciidoctor'
% zinit load z-shell/null
% which asciidoctor
asciidoctor() {
  local bindir=&quot;/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/z-shell---null/bin&quot;
  local -x GEM_HOME=&quot;/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/z-shell---null&quot;
  &quot;$bindir&quot;/&quot;asciidoctor&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h1 id="3_nodenode-module">3. <strong><code>node'{node-module}; …'</code></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#3_nodenode-module" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<h1 id="nodepath-to-binary_-_node-module_-_name-of-the-function"><strong><code>node'[{path-to-binary} &lt;-] !{node-module} [-&gt; {name-of-the-function}]; …'</code></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#nodepath-to-binary_-_node-module_-_name-of-the-function" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Installs the node module of name <code>{node-module}</code> inside the plugin's or
snippet's directory.</p>
<p>In the second form it also creates a wrapper function identical to the one
created with <code>fbin''</code> ice.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% zinit delete z-shell/null
Delete /home/sg/.zinit/plugins/z-shell---null?
[yY/n…]
y
Done (action executed, exit code: 0)
% zinit ice node'remark &lt;- !remark-cli -&gt; remark; remark-man'
% zinit load z-shell/null
…installation messages…
% which remark
remark () {
        local bindir=&quot;/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/z-shell---null/node_modules/.bin&quot;
        local -x NODE_PATH=&quot;/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/z-shell---null&quot;/node_modules
        &quot;$bindir&quot;/&quot;remark&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case the name of the binary program provided by the node module is
different from its name, hence the second form with the <code>b &lt;- a -&gt; c</code> syntax
has been used.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="4_fmodgncneofunction-name">4. <strong><code>fmod'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{function-name}; …'</code></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#4_fmodgncneofunction-name" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>

<p>It wraps given function with the ability to set <code>$GEM_HOME</code>, etc. – the
meaning of the <code>g</code>,<code>n</code> and <code>c</code> flags is the same as in the <code>fbin''</code> ice.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% myfun() { pwd; ls -1 }
% zinit ice fmod'cgn:myfun'
% zinit load z-shell/null
% which myfun
myfun () {

<h1 id="5_sbingncneopath-to-binary_-_name-of-the-script">5. <strong><code>sbin'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-binary}[ -&gt; {name-of-the-script}]; …'</code></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#5_sbingncneopath-to-binary_-_name-of-the-script" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>It creates the so called <code>shim</code> known from <code>rbenv</code> – a wrapper script that
forwards the call to the actual binary. The script is created always under
the same, standard and single <code>$PATH</code> entry: <code>$ZPFX/bin</code> (which is
<code>~/.zinit/polaris/bin</code> by default).</p>
<p>The flags have the same meaning as with <code>fbin''</code> ice.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% zinit delete junegunn/fzf-bin
Delete /home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin?
[yY/n…]
y
Done (action executed, exit code: 0)
% zinit ice from&quot;gh-r&quot; sbin&quot;fzf&quot;
% zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin

#!/usr/bin/env zsh

function fzf {
    local bindir=&quot;/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin&quot;

<p>Creates a wrapper function that at each invocation sources the given file.
The second ice, <code>ferc''</code> works the same with the single difference that it
uses <code>eval "$(&lt;{path-to-script})"</code> instead of <code>source "{path-to-script}"</code> to
load the script.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% zinit ice fsrc&quot;myscript -&gt; myfunc&quot; ferc&quot;myscript&quot;
