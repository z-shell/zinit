<p>This document has been created after 4 years of creating software for Zshell
and receiving help from IRC channel #zsh. Avoiding forks was the main guideline
when creating the projects and this lead to multiple discoveries of Zsh constructs
that are fast, robust and do not depend on external tools. Such code is more like
Ruby or Perl code, less like top-down shell scripts.</p>
<h2 id="information">Information<a class="headerlink" href="#information" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="is_about_keeping_array_form">@ is about keeping array form<a class="headerlink" href="#is_about_keeping_array_form" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>How to access all array elements in a shell? The standard answer: <code>use @ subscript</code>, i.e. <code>${array[@]}</code>. However, this is the Bash &amp; Ksh way (and with
the option <code>KSH_ARRAYS</code>, Zsh also works this way, i.e. needs <code>@</code> to access
whole array). Zshell <strong>is different</strong>: it is <code>$array</code> that refers to all
elements anyway. There is no need of <code>@</code> subscript.</p>
<p>So what use has <code>@</code> in the Zsh-world? It is: "<code>keep array form</code>" or "<code>do not join</code>". When is it activated? When user quotes the array, i.e. invokes
<code>"$array"</code>, he induces <em>joining</em> of all array elements (into a single string).
<code>@</code> is to have elements still quoted (so empty elements are
preserved), but not joined.</p>
<p>Two forms are available, <code>"$array[@]"</code> and <code>"${(@)array}"</code>. First form has
additional effect – when option <code>KSH_ARRAYS</code> is set, it indeed induces
referencing to whole array instead of first element only. It should then use
braces, i.e. <code>${array[@]}</code>, <code>"${array[@]}"</code> (<code>KSH_ARRAYS</code> requirement).</p>
<p>In practice, if you'll use <code>@</code> as a subscript – <code>[@]</code>, not as a flag –
<code>${(@)...}</code>, then you'll make the code <code>KSH_ARRAYS</code>-compatible.</p>
<h3 id="extended_glob">extended_glob<a class="headerlink" href="#extended_glob" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Glob-flags <code>#b</code> and <code>#m</code> require <code>setopt extended_glob</code>. Patterns utilizing <code>~</code>
and <code>^</code> also require it. Extended-glob is one of the main features of Zsh.</p>
<h2 id="constructs">Constructs<a class="headerlink" href="#constructs" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="reading_a_file">Reading a file<a class="headerlink" href="#reading_a_file" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">declare -a lines; lines=( &quot;${(@f)&quot;$(&lt;path/file)&quot;}&quot; )
</code></pre>
<p>This preserves empty lines because of double-quoting (the outside one).
<code>@</code>-flag is used to obtain array instead of scalar. If you don't want empty
lines preserved, you can also skip <code>@</code>-splitting, as it is explained in
Information section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">declare -a lines; lines=( ${(f)&quot;$(&lt;path/file)&quot;} )
</code></pre>
<p>Note: <code>$(&lt;...)</code> construct strips trailing empty lines.</p>
<h3 id="reading_from_stdin">Reading from stdin<a class="headerlink" href="#reading_from_stdin" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>This topic is governed by the same principles a the previous paragraph
(<code>Reading a file</code>), with the single difference that instead of the substitution
<code>"$(&lt;file-path)"</code> the substitution that should be used is <code>"$(command arg1 ...)"</code>, i.e.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">declare -a lines; lines=( ${(f)&quot;$(command arg1 ...)&quot;} )
</code></pre>
<p>This will read the <code>command's</code> output into the array <code>lines</code>. The version that
does <code>@</code> splitting and retains any empty lines is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">declare -a lines; lines=( &quot;${(f@)$(command arg1 ...)}&quot; )
</code></pre>
<p>Note that instead of four double-quotes <code>"</code>, an idiom that is justified (simply
suggested) by the Zsh documentation (and was used in the previous paragraph, in
the snippet <code>... "${(@f)"$(&lt;path/file)"}" ...</code>), only <strong>two</strong> double-quotes are
being used. I've investigated this form with the main Zsh developers on the
<code>zsh-workers@zsh.org</code> mailing list, and it was clearly stated that single,
outside quoting of <code>${(f@)...}</code> substitution works as if it was also separately
applied to <code>$(command ...)</code> (or to <code>$(&lt;file-path)</code>) inner substitution, so the
second double-quoting isn't actually needed.</p>
<h3 id="skipping_grep">Skipping grep<a class="headerlink" href="#skipping_grep" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>declare -a lines; lines=( &quot;${(@f)&quot;$(&lt;path/file)&quot;}&quot; )
declare -a grepped; grepped=( ${(M)lines:#*query*} )
</code></pre>
<p>To have <code>grep -v</code> effect, skip <code>M</code>-flag. To grep case insensitively, use <code>#i</code> glob
flag (<code>...:#(#i)*query*}</code>).</p>
<p>As it can be seen, <code>${...:#...}</code> substitution is a filtering of array, which by
default filters-out elements (<code>(M)</code> flag induces the opposite behavior). When
used with string, not an array, it behaves similarily: returns empty string when
<code>{input_string_var:#pattern}</code> matches whole input string.</p>
<p>Side-note: <code>(M)</code> flag can be used also with <code>${(M)var#pattern}</code> and other
substitutions, to retain what's matched by the pattern instead of removing that.</p>
<h4 id="multi-line_matching_like_with_grep">Multi-line matching like with grep<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-line_matching_like_with_grep" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Suppose you have a Subversion repository and want to check if it contains files
being not under version control. You could do this in Bash style like follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">local svn_status=&quot;$(svn status)&quot;
if [[ -n &quot;$(echo &quot;$svn_status&quot; | grep \^\?)&quot; ]]; then
  echo found
fi
</code></pre>
<p>That are 3 forks: for <code>svn status</code>, for <code>echo</code> and for <code>grep</code>. This can be solved
by <code>:#</code> substitution and <code>(M)</code> flag described above in this section (just check
if the number of matched lines is greater than 0). However, there's a more direct
approach:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">local svn_status=&quot;$(svn status)&quot; nl=$'\n'
if [[ &quot;$svn_status&quot; = *((#s)|$nl)\?* ]]; then
  echo found
fi
</code></pre>
<p>This requires <code>extendedglob</code>. The <code>(#s)</code> means: "start of the string". So
<code>((#s)|$nl)</code> means "start of the string OR preceded by a new-line".</p>
<p>If the <code>extendedglob</code> option cannot be used for some reason, this can be
achieved also
without it, but essentially it means that alternative (i.e. <code>|</code>) of two
versions of the pattern will have to be matched:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">setopt localoptions noextendedglob
local svn_status=&quot;$(svn status)&quot; nl=$'\n'
if [[ &quot;$svn_status&quot; = (\?*|*$nl\?*) ]]; then
  echo found
fi
</code></pre>
<p>In general, multi-line matching falls into the following idiom (<code>extendedglob</code>
version):</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">local needle=&quot;?&quot; required_preceding='[[:space:]]#'
[[ &quot;$(svn status)&quot; = *((#s)|$nl)${~required_preceding}${needle}* ]] &amp;&amp; echo found
</code></pre>
<p>It does a single fork (calls <code>svn status</code>). The <code>${~variable}</code> means (the <code>~</code>
in it): "the variable is holding a pattern, interpret it". All in all, instead
of regular expressions we were using patterns (globs) (see
<a href="#using_built-in_regular_expressions_engine">this section</a>).</p>
<h3 id="pattern_matching_in_and-fashion">Pattern matching in AND-fashion<a class="headerlink" href="#pattern_matching_in_and-fashion" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>[[ &quot;abc xyz efg&quot; = *abc*~^*efg* ]] &amp;&amp; print Match found
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>~</code> is a negation -- <code>match *abc* but not ...</code>. Then, <code>^</code> is also a negation.
The effect is: <code>*abc* but not those that don't have *efg*</code> which equals to:
<code>*abc* but those that have also *efg*</code>. This is a regular pattern and it can
be used with <code>:#</code> above to search arrays, or with <code>R</code>-subscript flag to search
hashes (<code>${hsh[(R)*pattern*]}</code>), etc. Inventor of those patterns is Mikael
Magnusson.</p>
<h3 id="skipping_tr">Skipping tr<a class="headerlink" href="#skipping_tr" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>declare -A map; map=( a 1 b 2 );
text=( &quot;ab&quot; &quot;ba&quot; )
text=( ${text[@]//(#m)?/${map[$MATCH]}} )
print $text ▶ 12 21
</code></pre>
<p><code>#m</code> flag enables the <code>$MATCH</code> parameter. At each <code>//</code> substitution, <code>$map</code> is
queried for character-replacement. You can substitute a text variable too, just
skip <code>[@]</code> and parentheses in assignment.</p>
<h3 id="ternary_expressions_with_--_substitutions">Ternary expressions with <code>+,-,:+,:-</code> substitutions<a class="headerlink" href="#ternary_expressions_with_--_substitutions" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>HELP=&quot;yes&quot;; print ${${HELP:+help enabled}:-help disabled} ▶ help enabled
HELP=&quot;&quot;; print ${${HELP:+help enabled}:-help disabled} ▶ help disabled
</code></pre>
<p>Ternary expression is known from <code>C</code> language but exists also in Zsh, but
directly only in math context, i.e. <code>(( a = a &gt; 0 ? b : c ))</code>. Flexibility of
Zsh allows such expressions also in normal context. Above is an example. <code>:+</code> is
"if not empty, substitute …" <code>:-</code> is "if empty, substitute …". You can save
great number of lines of code with those substitutions, it's normally at least
4-lines <code>if</code> condition or lenghty <code>&amp;&amp;</code>/<code>||</code> use.</p>
<h3 id="ternary_expressions_with_substitution">Ternary expressions with <code>:#</code> substitution<a class="headerlink" href="#ternary_expressions_with_substitution" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>var=abc; print ${${${(M)var:#abc}:+is abc}:-not abc} ▶ is abc
var=abcd; print ${${${(M)var:#abc}:+is abc}:-not abc} ▶ not abc
</code></pre>
<p>An one-line "if var = x, then …, else …". Again, can spare a great amount of boring
code that makes 10-line function a 20-line one.</p>
<h3 id="using_built-in_regular_expressions_engine">Using built-in regular expressions engine<a class="headerlink" href="#using_built-in_regular_expressions_engine" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>[[ &quot;aabbb&quot; = (#b)(a##)*(b(#c2,2)) ]] &amp;&amp; print ${match[1]}-${match[2]} ▶ aa-bb
</code></pre>
<p><code>##</code> is: "1 or more". <code>(#c2,2)</code> is: "exactly 2". A few other constructs: <code>#</code> is
"0 or more", <code>?</code> is "any character", <code>(a|b|)</code> is "a or b or empty match". <code>#b</code>
enables the <code>$match</code> parameters. There's also <code>#m</code> but it has one parameter
<code>$MATCH</code> for whole matched text, not for any parenthesis.</p>
<p>Zsh patterns are basically a custom regular expressions engine. They are
slightly faster than <code>zsh/regex</code> module (used for <code>=~</code> operator) and don't have
that dependency (regex module can be not present, e.g. in default static build
of Zsh). Also, they can be used in substitutions, for example in <code>//</code>
substitution.</p>
<h3 id="skipping_uniq">Skipping uniq<a class="headerlink" href="#skipping_uniq" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>declare -aU array; array=( a a b ); print $array ▶ a b
declare -a array; array=( a a b ); print ${(u)array} ▶ a b
</code></pre>
<p>Enable <code>-U</code> flag for array so that it guards elements to be unique, or use
<code>u</code>-flag to uniquify elements of any array.</p>
<h3 id="skipping_awk">Skipping awk<a class="headerlink" href="#skipping_awk" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>declare -a list; list=( &quot;a,b,c,1,e&quot; &quot;p,q,r,2,t&quot; );
print &quot;${list[@]/(#b)([^,]##,)(#c3,3)([^,]##)*/${match[2]}}&quot; ▶ 1 2
</code></pre>
<p>The pattern specifies 3 blocks of <code>[^,]##,</code> so 3 "not-comma multiple times, then
comma", then single block of "not-comma multiple times" in second parentheses --
and then replaces this with second parentheses. Result is 4<sup>th</sup> column extracted
from multiple lines of text, something <code>awk</code> is often used for. Other method is
use of <code>s</code>-flag. For single line of text:</p>
<pre><code>text=&quot;a,b,c,1,e&quot;; print ${${(s:,:)text}[4]} ▶ 1
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to in-substitution code-execution capabilities it's possible to use
<code>s</code>-flag to apply it to multiple lines:</p>
<pre><code>declare -a list; list=( &quot;a,b,c,1,e&quot; &quot;p,q,r,2,t&quot; );
print &quot;${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(s:,:)MATCH}[4]}}&quot; ▶ 1 2
</code></pre>
<p>There is a problem with the <code>(s::)</code> flag that can be solved if Zsh is version
<code>5.4</code> or higher: if there will be single input column, e.g. <code>list=( "column1" "a,b")</code> instead of two or more columns (i.e. <code>list=( "column1,column2" "a,b" )</code>), then <code>(s::)</code> will return <strong>string</strong> instead of 1-element <strong>array</strong>. So the
index <code>[4]</code> in above snippet will index a string, and show its 4-th letter.
Starting with Zsh 5.4, thanks to a patch by Bart Schaefer (<code>40640: the (A) parameter flag forces array result even if...</code>), it is possible to force
<strong>array</strong>-kind of result even for single column, by adding <code>(A)</code> flag, i.e.:</p>
<pre><code>declare -a list; list=( &quot;a,b,c,1,e&quot; &quot;p,q,r,2,t&quot; &quot;column1&quot; );
print &quot;${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(As:,:)MATCH}[4]}}&quot; ▶ 1 2
print &quot;${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(s:,:)MATCH}[4]}}&quot; ▶ 1 2 u
</code></pre>
<p>Side-note: <code>(A)</code> flag is often used together with <code>::=</code> assignment-substitution
and <code>(P)</code> flag, to assign arrays and hashes by-name.</p>
<h3 id="searching_arrays">Searching arrays<a class="headerlink" href="#searching_arrays" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>declare -a array; array=( a b &quot; c1&quot; d ); print ${array[(r)[[:space:]][[:alpha:]]*]} ▶ c1

<p><code>[[:space:]]</code> contains unicode spaces. This is often used in conditional
expression like <code>[[ -z ${array[(r)...]} ]]</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="#skipping_grep">Skipping grep</a> that uses <code>:#</code> substitution can also
be used to search arrays.</p>
<h3 id="code_execution_in_substitution">Code execution in <code>//</code> substitution<a class="headerlink" href="#code_execution_in_substitution" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>

: ${array[@]/(#b)(Value ([[:digit:]]##)|*)/$(( ${#match[2]} &gt; 0 ? append(++idx) : ++idx ))}
print $gathered ▶ Value 1 Value 2
</code></pre>
<p>Use of <code>#b</code> glob flag enables math-code execution (and not only) in <code>/</code> and <code>//</code>
substitutions. Implementation is very fast.</p>
<h3 id="serializing_data">Serializing data<a class="headerlink" href="#serializing_data" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>declare -A hsh deserialized; hsh=( key value )
serialized=&quot;${(j: :)${(qkv@)hsh}}&quot;
deserialized=( &quot;${(Q@)${(z@)serialized}}&quot; )
print ${(kv)deserialized} ▶ key value
</code></pre>
<p><code>j</code>-flag means join -- by spaces, in this case. Flags <code>kv</code> mean: keys and values,
interleaving. Important <code>q</code>-flag means: quote. So what is obtained is each key
and value quoted, and put into string separated by spaces.</p>
<p><code>z</code>-flag means: split as if Zsh parser would split. So quoting (with backslashes,
double quoting and other) is recognized. Obtained is array <code>( "key" "value")</code>
which is then dequoted with <code>Q</code>-flag. This yields original data, assigned to
hash <code>deserialized</code>. Use this to e.g. implement array of hashes.</p>
<p>Note: to be compatible with <code>setopt ksharrays</code>, use <code>[@]</code> instead of <code>(@)</code>, e.g.:
<code>...( "${(Q)${(z)serialized[@]}[@]}" )</code></p>
<h5 id="tip_serializing_with_bash">Tip: serializing with Bash<a class="headerlink" href="#tip_serializing_with_bash" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<pre><code>array=( key1 key2 )
printf -v serialized &quot;%q &quot; &quot;${array[@]}&quot;
eval &quot;deserialized=($serialized)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This method works also with Zsh. The drawback is use of <code>eval</code>, however it's
impossible that any problem will occurr unless someone compromises variable's
value, but as always, <code>eval</code> should be avoided if possible.</p>

<h3 id="counting_unquoted-only_apostrophes">Counting unquoted-only apostrophes<a class="headerlink" href="#counting_unquoted-only_apostrophes" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>A project was needing this to do some Zle line-continuation tricks (when you
put a backslash-\ at the end of the line and press enter – it is the
line-continuation that occurs at that moment).</p>
<p>The required functionality is: in given string, count the number of
apostrophes, but <em>only the unquoted ones</em>. This means that only apostrophes
with null or an even number of preceding backslashes should be accepted into
the count:</p>
<pre><code>buf=&quot;word'continue\'after\\\'afterSecnd\\''afterPair&quot;
integer count=0
: ${buf//(#b)((#s)|[^\\])([\\][\\])#(\'\'#)/$(( count += ${#match[3]} ))}
echo $count ▶ 3
</code></pre>
<p>The answer (i.e. the output) to the above presentation and example is: <code>3</code>
(there are <code>3</code> unquoted apostrophes in total in the string kept in the variable
<code>$buf</code>).</p>
<p>Below follows a variation of above snippet that doesn't use math-code execution:</p>
<pre><code>buf=&quot;word'continue\'after\\\'afterSecnd\\''afterPair&quot;
buf=&quot;${(S)buf//(#b)*((#s)|[^\\])([\\][\\])#(\'\'#)*/${match[3]}}&quot;; buf=${buf%%[^\']##}
integer count=${#buf}
echo $count ▶ 3
</code></pre>
<p>This is possible thanks to <code>(S)</code> flag – non-greedy matching, <code>([\\][\\])#</code> trick – it
matches only unquoted following <code>(\'\'##)</code> characters (which are the apostrophes) and
a general strategy to replace <code>anything-apostrope(s)</code> (unquoted ones) with
<code>the-apostrope(s)</code> (and then count them with <code>${#buf}</code>).</p>

intuitive.</p>
