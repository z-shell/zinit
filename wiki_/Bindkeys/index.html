<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes plugins call <code>bindkey</code> to assign keyboard shortucts. This can cause
problems, because multiple plugins can bind the same keys. Also, the user might
want a different binding(s), which will require a complicated, additional
<code>bindkey</code> commands in <code>.zshrc</code>.</p>
<p>Zinit provides a solution to this problem – the ability to remap the bindkeys
with a short ice-modifier specification with the <code>bindmap''</code> ice.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-zsh"># Map Ctrl-G instead of Ctrl-R for the history searcher.
zinit bindmap'^R -&gt; ^G' for z-shell/history-search-multi-word

# Map Ctrl-Shift-Left and …-Right used by URxvt instead of the Xterms' ones.
#
# Load with the bindkey-tracking ↔ with light-loading for anything else.
#
# Could also separate the bindmaps with a semicolon, i.e.:
# bindmap'&quot;\\e[1\;6D&quot; -&gt; \\e[1\;5D ; &quot;\\e[1\;6C&quot; -&gt; ^[[1\;5C' \
zinit wait light-mode trackbinds bindmap'&quot;\\e[1\;6D&quot; -&gt; \\e[1\;5D&quot;' \
  bindmap'&quot;\\e[1\;6C&quot; -&gt; ^[[1\;5C' pick'dircycle.zsh' for \
  michaelxmcbride/zsh-dircycle

# Map space to regular space and Ctrl-Space to the `globalias' widget, which
# expands the alias entered on the left (provided by OMZ globalias plugin).
zinit bindmap='!&quot; &quot; -&gt; magic-space; !&quot;^ &quot; -&gt; globalias' nocompletions \
  depth=1 pick=plugins/globalias/globalias.plugin.zsh for \
  ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>As it can be seen, the <code>bindmap''</code> ice has two modes of operation: normal and
exclamation-mark (<code>bindmap'!…'</code>). In the first mode, the remapping is beind done
from-key to-key, i.e.: <code>bindmap'fromkey -&gt; to-key'</code>. In this mode, the given key
is being changed to the second given key in the <code>bindkey</code> command that's being
actually issued when loading the plugin.</p>
<p>In the second mode, the remapping is being done from-key to-widget, i.e.:
<code>bindmap'!from-key -&gt; to-widget'</code>. In this mode, the given key is being mapped
to the given widget instead of the widget specified in the <code>bindkey</code> command,
i.e.: instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">bindkey &quot;^ &quot; magic-space
bindkey &quot; &quot; globalias
</code></pre>
<p>the actual call that'll be done will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">bindkey &quot;^ &quot; globalias
bindkey &quot; &quot; magic-space
</code></pre>
<p>(for the <code>bindmap='!" " -&gt; magic-space; !"^ " -&gt; globalias'</code> ice).</p>
<h2 id="using_the_upar_etc_shorthands">Using The <code>UPAR</code>, Etc. Shorthands<a class="headerlink" href="#using_the_upar_etc_shorthands" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are four special values that can be used on the left side of the bind-map:
<code>UPAR</code>, <code>DOWNAR</code>, <code>LEFTAR</code>, <code>RIGHTAR</code>. They'll match up arrow, down arrow, etc.
So that it's possible to do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit bindmap='LEFTAR -&gt; ^F; RIGHTAR -&gt; ^G' …
</code></pre>
<p>The benefits of using the <code>UPAR</code>, … shorthands is that they cover multiple
possible cursor-key codes for each of the cursor key, so that they'll work
regardless of the terminal being used.</p>
<h2 id="using_bindmap_in_light_mode">Using <code>bindmap''</code> In Light Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#using_bindmap_in_light_mode" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>When the investigation mode is on – i.e.: when the full loading mode is being
used (default in the <code>for</code> syntax and when <code>zinit load …</code> is used) – then the
<code>bindmap''</code> ice works normally. In the non-investigation, i.e.: the light mode
– activated when <code>zinit light …</code> or the <code>light-mode</code> ice is being used – the
<code>bindmap''</code> is unavailable, unless the <code>trackbinds</code> ice is specified, i.e.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh"># With use of the light-mode ice and the for-syntax:
zinit light-mode trackbinds bindmap'^R -&gt; ^G' for z-shell/history-search-multi-word

# With use of the classic syntax:
zinit trackbinds bindmap'^R -&gt; ^G' for z-shell/history-search-multi-word
zinit light z-shell/history-search-multi-word
</code></pre>
