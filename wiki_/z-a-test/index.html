<p>Zinit extension that runs tests (via <code>make test</code>, for example) – if it finds
any of them – after installing and updating a plugin or snippet. Simply load it
as a plugin to make it active:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit light z-shell/z-a-test
</code></pre>
<p>Example activation in the default quiet mode:</p>
<p><img alt="z-a-test activation" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/z-a-test/main/images/z-p-test-1.png" /></p>
<p>Example activation in non-quiet mode:</p>
<p><img alt="z-a-test activation" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/z-a-test/main/images/z-p-test-2.png" /></p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Simply load as a plugin. This will install the extension within Zinit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit light z-shell/z-a-test
</code></pre>
