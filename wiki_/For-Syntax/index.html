                <h1 id="the_for-syntax">The For-Syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#the_for-syntax" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="../INTRODUCTION/">Introduction</a> covers the classic Zinit invocation
syntax, which is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit ice …
zinit load … # or zinit light, zinit snippet
</code></pre>
<p>It is a fundamental Zinit syntax. However, a more concise, optimized syntax,
called <em>for-syntax</em>, is also available. It is best presented by a real-world
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit as&quot;null&quot; wait&quot;3&quot; lucid for \
  sbin Fakerr/git-recall \
  sbin paulirish/git-open \
  sbin paulirish/git-recent \
  sbin davidosomething/git-my \
  make&quot;PREFIX=$ZPFX install&quot; iwata/git-now \
  make&quot;PREFIX=$ZPFX&quot; tj/git-extras
</code></pre>
<p>Above single command installs 6 plugins (Git extension-packages), with the base
ices <code>as"null" wait"3" lucid</code> that are common to all of the plugins and
6 plugin-specific add-on ices.</p>
<h2 id="a_few_remarks">A Few Remarks<a class="headerlink" href="#a_few_remarks" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The syntax automatically detects if the object is a snippet or a plugin, by
  checking if the object is an URL, i.e.: if it starts with <code>http*://</code> or
  <code>OMZ::</code>, etc.</li>
<li>To load a local-file snippet (which will be treaten as a local-directory
  plugin by default) use the <code>is-snippet</code> ice,</li>
<li>To load a plugin in <code>light</code> mode use the <code>light-mode</code> ice.</li>
<li>If the plugin name collides with an ice name, precede the plugin name with
  <code>@</code>, e.g.: <code>@sharkdp/fd</code> (collides with the <code>sh</code> ice, Zinit will take the
  plugin name as <code>sh"arkdp/fd"</code>), see the next section for an example.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Load a few useful binary (i.e.: binary packages from the GitHub Releases) utils:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit as&quot;null&quot; wait&quot;2&quot; lucid from&quot;gh-r&quot; for \
  mv&quot;exa* -&gt; exa&quot; sbin ogham/exa \
  mv&quot;fd* -&gt; fd&quot; sbin&quot;fd/fd&quot; @sharkdp/fd \
  sbin&quot;fzf&quot; junegunn/fzf-bin
</code></pre>
<p>Note: <code>sbin''</code> is an ice added by the
<a href="https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node">z-a-bin-gem-node</a> annex, it
provides the command to the command line without altering <code>$PATH</code>. If the name
of the command is the same as the name of the plugin, the ice contents can be
skipped.</p>
<p>Turbo load some plugins, without any plugin-specific ices:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit wait lucid for \
  hlissner/zsh-autopair \
  urbainvaes/fzf-marks
</code></pre>
<p>Load two Oh My Zsh files as snippets, in Turbo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zinit wait lucid for \
  OMZ::lib/git.zsh \
  atload&quot;unalias grv&quot; OMZ::plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh
</code></pre>
<p><a href="vim:set ft=markdown tw=80 fo+=a1n autoindent:"></a></p>
