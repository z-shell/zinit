    Hack: check whether the content contains a h1 headline. If it does, the

<p>They are <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Azinit-annex+org%3Az-shell&amp;type=Repositories">Zinit Extensions</a>. An annex is added to Zinit by simply loading it
just as any other plugin.</p>
<h2 id="what_can_they_do">What Can They Do?<a class="headerlink" href="#what_can_they_do" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add a new Zinit subcommand (i.e. the command that’s placed after the
   function <code>zinit …</code> when calling Zinit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new ice-modifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register four type of hooks:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>atclone</code> hook – run after cloning any plugin or downloading any snippet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>atpull</code> hook – run after pulling new commits (i.e. updating) for any plugin / snippet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>atinit</code> hook – run before loading any plugin / snippet, after it has been set-up (i.e. downloaded).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>atload</code> hook – run after loading any plugin / snippet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register hooks for generating help text, shown by the <code>zinit help</code> subcommand.</p>
</li>

<p>Below is an example body of an <code>atclone</code> hook (taken from
<a href="https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-submods"><strong>zinit/z-a-submods</strong></a> annex). It
shows how to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Obtain the arguments passed to the hook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an ice modifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also shows an useful snippet that will trim the whitespace in array elements (see <code># (4) …</code> in the code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilize the last hook argument – the plugin’s/snippet’s containing directory.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</code></pre>
<p>The recommended method of creating a hook is to place its body into a file that
starts with a right arrow <code>→</code> (<a href="http://z-shell.github.io/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html#namespacing">more
information</a>,
and also a <code>za-</code> prefix, e.g. <code>→za-myproject-atclone-hook</code> and then to mark it
for autoloading via <code>autoload -Uz →za-myproject-atclone-hook</code>. Then register the
hook (presumably in the <code>myproject.plugin.zsh</code> file) with the API call:
<code>@zinit-register-annex</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">@zinit-register-annex myproject hook:atclone \
  →za-myproject-atclone-handler \
  →za-myproject-atclone-help-handler \
  &quot;submods''&quot; # register a new ice-mod: submods''
</code></pre>
<p>The general syntax of the API call is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">@zinit-register-annex {project-name} \
  {hook: \
  {name-of-the-handler-function} \
  {name-of-the-HELP-handler-function} \
  &quot;{ice-mod1}|{ice-mod2}|…&quot; &lt; hook-type &gt;| subcommand: &lt; new-subcommand-name &gt; }
</code></pre>
<p>The last argument, i.e. the <code>|</code>-separated ice-list, is optional. That’s all!
After this loading the plugin <code>myproject</code> will set up the new ice-mod <code>submods</code>
that will have syntax <code>submods'{user}/{plugin} –&gt; {output-dir}; …'</code> and
will clone submodules when installing the original plugin or snippet! Example
real-world use of the ice-mod:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh"># Load the `zsh-autosuggestions' plugin via Prezto module: `autosuggestions'
zinit ice svn submods'zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions -&gt; external'
zinit snippet PZT::modules/autosuggestions
</code></pre>
<p>Checkout the project which fully implements this idea,
<a href="https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-submods"><strong>zinit/z-a-submods</strong></a>. It e.g. also
implements the <code>atpull</code> hook, i.e. supports automatic update of the submodules.
The <code>z-a-*</code> prefix is recommended for projects that are being annexes.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details<a class="headerlink" href="#details" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are 2 or 3 subtypes for each of the hook:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>atinit</code> or <code>!atinit</code> – the <code>!</code> version is ran before the <code>atinit</code>
    <strong>ice-mod</strong> (i.e. before <code>zinit ice atinit'echo this!'; …</code>), while
    the normal version runs after it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>atload</code> or <code>!atload</code> – analogous to the <code>atinit</code> case: the <code>!</code> version runs
    before the <code>atload</code> <strong>ice-mod</strong> (while the normal version runs after it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>atclone</code> or <code>!atclone</code> – analogous to the <code>atinit</code> and <code>atload</code> cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>atpull</code>, <code>!atpull</code> or <code>%atpull</code> – the first two are being ran <strong>only when
    there are new commits to be downloaded</strong> during the update. The <code>%</code> version
    is being <strong>always</strong> run, regardless if the update will pull any actual
    commits or not, and it is being ran <strong>after</strong> the <code>atpull</code> <strong>ice-mod</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
