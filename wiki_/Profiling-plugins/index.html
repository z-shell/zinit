</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>atinit''</code> loads <code>zsh/zprof</code> module (shipped with Zsh) before loading the
  plugin – this starts the profiling,</li>
<li><code>atload''</code> works after loading the plugin – shows profiling results (<code>zprof | head</code>), unloads <code>zsh/zprof</code> - this stops the profiling; in the effect, only a
  single plugin (in this case <code>z-shell/fast-syntax-highlighting</code>) will be
  profiled while the rest of the e.g. zshrc processing will go on completely
  normally,</li>
<li>the <code>light</code> loads without reporting enabled, so less Zinit code is being
  run – no Zinit code responsible for the tracking (i.e. the automatic data
  gathering, during loading of a plugin, for the reports and the possibility to
  unload the plugin) will be activated and the functions will not appear in the
  <code>zprof</code> report.</li>
