## News

<details>
  <summary>Here are the new features and updates added to Zinit in the last 90 days.</summary>

- 08-11-2021

  - Zinit Packages for `zinit pack ...` listed in [#zinit-package](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Azinit-package+org%3Az-shell&type=Repositories) topic.
  - Zinit Annexes (i.e. an extension) listed in [#zinit-annex](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Azinit-annex+org%3Az-shell&type=Repositories) topic.
  - Zinit Services listed in [#zinit-service](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Azinit-service+org%3Az-shell&type=Repositories) topic.
  - [Zinit Wiki](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/) mostly restored.

- 05-11-2021

  - The packages have been disconnected from NPM registry and now live only on z-shell organization under [#zinit-package](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Azinit-package+org%3Az-shell&type=Repositories) topic. Publishing to NPM isn't needed.
  - There are two interesting packages,
    [any-gem](https://github.com/z-shell/any-gem) and
    [any-node](https://github.com/z-shell/any-node). They allow to install any
    Gem(s) or Node module(s) locally in a newly created plugin directory. For example:

    ```zsh
    zinit pack param='GEM -> rails' for any-gem
    zinit pack param='MOD -> doctoc' for any-node
    # To have the command in zshrc, add an id-as'' ice so that
    # Zinit knows that the package is already installed
    # (also: the Unicode arrow is allowed)
    zinit id-as=jekyll pack param='GEM → jekyll' for any-gem
    ```

    The binaries will be exposed without altering the PATH via shims
    ([Bin-Gem-Node](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node) annex is needed).
    Shims are correctly removed when deleting a plugin with `zinit delete …`.

- 16-07-2020

  - A new ice `null` which works exactly the same as `as"null"`, i.e.: it makes
    the plugin a _null_-one ↔ without any scripts sourced (by default, unless
    `src''` or `multisrc''` are given) and compiled, and without any completions
    searched / installed. Example use case:

        zi null sbin"vims" for MilesCranmer/vim-stream

    instead of:

        zi as"null" sbin"vims" for MilesCranmer/vim-stream

    .

  - A **new annex** [**Unscope**](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-unscope) :)
    It's goal is: to allow the usage of the unscoped — i.e.: given without any
    GitHub user name — plugin IDs. Basically it allows to specify, e.g.: **zinit load
    _zsh-syntax-highlighting_** instead of **zinit load
    _zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting_**. It'll automatically send a request to
    the GitHub API searching for the best candidate (max. # of stars and of
    forks). It also has an embedded, static database of short _nicknames_ for
    some of the plugins out there (requests for addition are welcomed), e.g.:
    **vi-reg** for **zsh-vi-more/evil-registers**.

  - A fresh and elastic hook-based architecture has been implemented and
    deployed — the code is much cleaner and the development will be easier,
    i.e.: quicker :).

  - Set of small improvements: **a)** `silent''` mutes the `Snippet not loaded`
    error message, **b)** much shorter lag/pause after a plugin installation or
    update, **c)** the 256 color palette is being now used for plugin IDs, if
    available, **d)** if possible (a UTF-8 locale is needed to be set), the Unicode
    three-dots `…` will be used instead of `...` in the messages, **e)**
    nicer snippet IDs in the installation and update messages, **f)** the
    annexes can be now loaded in any order without influencing their operation
    in any way (there have been some issues with
    [Patch-Dl](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-patch-dl) and
    [As-Monitor](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-as-monitor) annexes), **g)**
    `compile''` can now obtain multiple patterns separated via semicolon (`;`).

- 25-06-2020

  - Ability to call the autoloaded function at the moment of loading it by
    `autoload'#fun'`, i.e.: by prefixing it with the hash sigh (`#`). So that
    it's possible to invoke e.g.:

    ```zsh
    zinit autoload'#manydots-magic' for knu/zsh-manydots-magic
    ```

    instead of:

    ```zsh
    zinit autoload'manydots-magic' atload'manydots-magic' for \
        knu/zsh-manydots-magic
    ```

- 20-06-2020

  - The [Bin-Gem-Node](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node) annex now
    has an explicit Cygwin support — it creates additional, **extra shim files**
    — Windows batch scripts that allow to run the shielded applications from
    e.g.: Windows run dialog — if the `~/.zinit/polaris/bin` directory is being
    added to the Windows `PATH` environment variable, for example (it is a good
    idea to do so, IMHO). The Windows shims (_shims_ are command-wrapper scripts
    that are in general created with the `sbin''` ice of the annex) have the
    same name as the standard ones (which are also being created, normally) plus
    the `.cmd` extension. You can test the feature by e.g.: installing Firefox
    from the Zinit package via:

    ```zsh
    zinit pack=bgn for firefox
    ```

  - All cURL progress bars are now guaranteed to be single line — this is being
    done by a wrapper script.

  - I thought that I'll share an interesting function-type that I'm using within
    Zinit - a function that outputs messages with theming and colors easily
    available:

    ```zsh
    typeset -gA COLORS=(
        col-error  $'\e[31m'
        col-file   $'\e[38;5;110m'
        col-url    $'\e[38;5;45m'
        col-meta   $'\e[38;5;221m'
        col-meta2  $'\e[38;5;154m'
        col-data   $'\e[38;5;82m'
        col-data2  $'\e[38;5;50m'
        col-rst    $'\e[0m'
        col-can-be-empty ""
    )

    m() {
        builtin emulate -LR zsh -o extendedglob
        if [[ $1 = -* ]] { local opt=$1; shift } else { local opt }
        local msg=${(j: :)${@//(#b)([\[\{]([^\]\}]##)[\]\}])/${COLORS[col-$match[2]]-$match[1]}}}
        builtin print -Pr ${opt:#--} -- $msg
    }
    ```

    Usage is as follows:

    ```zsh
    m "{error}ERROR:{rst} The {meta}data{rst} has the value: {data}value{rst}"
    ```

    Effect:

    ![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/zinit/main/doc/img/m.png)

    The function is available in the `atinit''`, `atload''`, etc. hooks.

- 17-06-2020

  - `ziextract` and `extract''` now support Windows installers — currently the
    installer of Firefox. Let me know if any of your installers doesn't work.
    You can test the installer with the Firefox Developer Edition Zinit
    [package](https://github.com/z-shell/firefox-dev):

    ```zsh
    zinit pack"bgn" for firefox-dev
    ```

    The above command will work on Windows (at least on Cygwin), Linux and OS X.

- 13-06-2020

  - `ziextract` has a new `--move2` option, which moves files two levels up
    after unpacking. For example, if there will be an archive file with
    directory structure: `Pulumi/bin/{pulumi,pulumi2}`, then after `ziextract --move2 --auto` there will be the two files moved to the top level dir:
    `./{pulumi,pulumi2}`. To obtain the same effect using the `extract''` ice,
    pass two exclamation marks, i.e.: `extract'!!'`. A real-world example — it
    uses [z-a-as-monitor](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-as-monitor) and
    [z-a-bin-gem-node](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node) annexes to
    download a Zip package that has the files inside two-level nested directory
    tree:

    ```zsh
    zi id-as`pulumi` as`monitor|null` mv`pulumi pulumi_` extract`!` \
        dlink=`https://get.pulumi.com/releases/sdk/pulumi-%VERSION%-windows-x64.zip` \
        sbin`pulumi*` for \
            https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/
    ```

- 12-06-2020

  - New options to `update`: `-s/--snippets` and `-l/--plugins` — they're
    limiting the `update --all` to only plugins or snippets. Example:

    ```zsh
    zinit update --plugins
    ```

    Work also with `-p/--parallel`.

- 15-05-2020

  - The `autoload''` ice can now rename the autoloaded functions, i.e.: load
    a function from a file `func-A` as a function `func-B` via: `autoload'func-A -> func-B; …'`.
  - Also, an alternate autoloading method - via: `eval "func-file() { $(<func-file); }"` — has been exposed — in order to use it, precede the
    ice contents with an exclamation mark, i.e.: `autoload'!func-file'`. The
    rename mode uses this method by default.

- 12-05-2020

  - A new feature — ability to substitute `stringA` → `stringB` in plugin source
    body before executing by `subst'A -> B'`. Works also for any nested `source`
    commands. Example — renaming the `dl''` ice into a `dload''` ice in the
    [Patch-Dl](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-patch-dl) annex:

    ```zsh
    zinit subst"dl'' -> dload''" for z-shell/z-a-patch-dl
    ```

  - A new ice `autoload''` which invokes `autoload -Uz …` on the given
    files/functions. Example — a plugin that converts `cd ...` into
    `cd ../..` that lacks proper setup in any `*.plugin.zsh` file:

    ```zsh
    zinit as=null autoload=manydots-magic atload=manydots-magic for \
        knu/zsh-manydots-magic
    ```

- 09-05-2020

  - The `from'gh-r'` downloading of the binary files from GitHub releases can
    now download **multiple files** — if you specify multiple `bpick''` ices
    **or** separate the patterns with a semicolon (**`;`**). Example:

    ```zsh
    zinit from"gh-r" as"program" mv"krew-* -> krew" bpick"*.yaml" bpick"*.tar.gz" for \
    kubernetes-sigs/krew
    ```

  - A new ice `opts''` which takes options to **sticky-set** during sourcing of
    the plugin. This means that thee options will be also set for all of the
    _functions_ that the plugin defines — **during their execution**
    (<i>**only**</i>). The option list is space separated. Example:

    ```zsh
    # Suppose the example test plugin has the following in test.plugin.zsh:
    #
    # print $options[kshglob] $options[shglob]
    #
    # Then:

    zinit opts"kshglob noshglob" for z-shell/test

    # Outputs:
    on off

    # Can mix with the standard emulation-ices: sh, bash, ksh, csh, zsh (the
    # default one)

    zinit sh opts"kshglob" for z-shell/test

    # Outputs `on' for the SH_GLOB, because sh-emulation sets this option
    on on
    ```

- 07-05-2020

  - A new `from''` value is available — `cygwin`. It'll cause to download
    a package from the Cygwin repository — from a random mirror, and then
    unpack it. Example use:

    ```zsh
    # Install gzip and expose it through Bin-Gem-Node annex's sbin'' ice
    zinit from"cygwin" sbin"usr/bin/gzip.exe -> gzip" for gzip
    ```

- 16-04-2020

  - Turbo plugins will now get gracefully preinstalled first before the prompt
    (i.e.: within `zshrc` processing) and then loaded **still** as Turbo plugins.

- 15-04-2020

  - The `…/name.plugin.zsh` and `…/init.zsh` can be now skipped from single-file
    (non-svn) snippet URLs utilizing the `OMZ::…`, etc. shorthands. Example:

    ```zsh
    # Instead of: zinit for OMZP::ruby/ruby.plugin.zsh
    zinit for OMZP::ruby
    # Instead of: zinit for PZTM::rails/init.zsh
    zinit for PZTM::rails
    # Instead of: zinit for OMZT::gnzh.zsh-theme
    zinit for OMZT::gnzh
    ```

  - New prefixes `OMZP::` **=** `OMZ::/plugins/`, `OMZT::` **=**
    `OMZ::/themes/`, `OMZL::` **=** `OMZ::lib/`, `PZTM::` **=** `PZT::modules/`,
    for both svn and single-file snippets. Example use:

    ```zsh
    zinit for OMZP::ruby/ruby.plugin.zsh
    zinit svn for OMZP::ruby
    ```

    (instead of:

    ```zsh
    zinit for OMZ::plugins/ruby/ruby.plugin.zsh
    zinit svn for OMZ::plugins/ruby
    ```

    ).

- 12-04-2020

  - A new document on the Wiki is available — about the [**bindmap''
    ice**](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Bindkeys/).
  - If `id-as''` will have no value, then it'll work as
    [**id-as'auto'**](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/id-as/#id-asauto).

- 07-04-2020

  - A new feature — `param''` ice that defines params for the time of loading of
    the plugin or snippet. E.g.:

    ```zsh
    # Equivalent of `local myparam=1 myparam2=1' right before loading of the plugin
    zinit param'myparam → 1; myparam2 -> 1' for z-shell/null
    # Equivalent of `local myparam myparam2' before loading of the plugin
    zinit param'myparam; myparam2' for z-shell/null
    ```

  - The `atinit''` ice can now be investigated — if it'll be prepended with `!`,
    i.e.: `atinit'!…'`.

- 01-04-2020

  - As a user [noticed](https://github.com/z-shell/zinit/issues/293), Subversion
    isn't distributed with Xcode Command Line Tools anymore. Here's a [helpful
    snippet](https://www.reddit.com/r/zinit/wiki/gallery#wiki_building_and_installation_of_subversion)
    that installs Subversion with use of Zinit.

- 27-02-2020

  - An **important fix** has been pushed — due to a bug Turbo has been disabled
    for non-for syntax invocations of Zinit. Issue `zinit self-update` to
    resolve the mistake.
    - If you haven't updated yesterday, please restrain from running `zinit update` immediately after `self-update`. Support for reloading Zinit after
      `self-update` has been pushed yesterday and after pulling this feature,
      you'll be able to freely invoke `self-update` and `update`.

- 26-02-2020

  - From now on `zinit self-update` reloads Zinit for the current session (after
    updating the plugin manager), and `zinit update --all/-p/--parallel` detects
    that `self-update` has been run in **another session** and also reloads Zinit
    right before performing the update. This way the update code is always the
    newest and consistent.

- 26-02-2020

  - If the loaded object (plugin or snippet) is not already installed when
    loading, then Turbo gets automatically disabled for this single loading of
    the object — it'll be installed before prompt, not after it and also
    immediately (without waiting the number of seconds given to `wait''`), i.e.:
    during the normal processing of `zshrc`, which intuitively is the expected
    behavior.
  - The additional disk accesses for the checks cost about 10 ms out of 150 ms
    (i.e.: the Zsh startup time increases from 140 ms to 150 ms). If you want,
    you may disable the feature by setting `$ZINIT[OPTIMIZE_OUT_DISK_ACCESSES]`
    to `1`.
  - A bug in Turbo has been fixed that was delaying the objects' loadings,
    especially when there were no keystrokes issued.

- 20-02-2020

  - A new feature - **parallel updates** of all plugins and snippets — Zinit runs
    series of spawned concurrent-job groups of size 15 to speed up the update process.
    To activate, pass `-p`/`--parallel` to `update`, e.g.:

    ```zsh
    zinit update -p
    zinit update --parallel
    # Increase the number of jobs in a concurrent-set to 40
    zinit update --parallel 40
    ```

    See demos: [asciicast1](https://asciinema.org/a/303174),
    [asciicast2](https://asciinema.org/a/303184).

  - A new article is available on the Wiki — about the
    [**`extract`**](http://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/extract-Ice/) ice.

- 09-02-2020

  Note that the ice `extract` can handle files with spaces — to encode such a name use
  the non-breaking space (Right Alt + Space) in place of the in-filename spaces :).

- 07-02-2020
  - A new ice `extract` which extracts:
    - all files with recognized archive extensions like `zip`, `tar.gz`, etc.,
    - if no such files will be found, then: all files with recognized archive
      **types** (examined with the `file` command),
    - OR, IF GIVEN — the given files, e.g.: `extract'file1.zip file2.tgz'`,
    - the automatic searching for archives ignores files in sub-sub-directories and
      located deeper,
  - It has a `!` flag — i.e.: `extract'!…'` — it'll cause the files to be moved
    one directory-level up upon unpacking,
  - and also a `-` flag — i.e.: `extract'-…'` — it'll prevent removal of the archive
    after unpacking; useful to allow comparing timestamps with the server in case of
    snippet-downloaded file,
  - the flags can be combined, e.g.: `extract'!-'`,
  - also, the function `ziextract` has a new option `--auto`, which causes the
    automatic behavior identical to the empty `extract` ice.
- 21-01-2020

  - A few tips for the project rename following the field reports (the issues created
    by users):
    - the `ZPLGM` hash is now `ZINIT`,
    - the annexes are moved under [z-shell](https://github.com/z-shell)
      organization.

- 19-01-2020

  - The name has been changed to **Zinit** based on the results of the
    [poll](https://github.com/z-shell/zinit/issues/235).
  - In general, you don't have to do anything after the name change.
  - Only a run of `zinit update --all` might be necessary.
  - You might also want to rename your `zplugin` calls in `zshrc` to `zinit`.
  - Zinit will reuse `~/.zplugin` directory if it exists, otherwise it'll create
    `~/.zinit`.

- 15-01-2020

  - There's a new function, `ziextract`, which unpacks the given file. It supports many
    formats (notably also `dmg` images) — if there's a format that's unsupported please
    don't hesitate to [make a
    request](https://github.com/z-shell/zinit/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
    for it to be added. A few facts:
    - the function is available only at the time of the plugin/snippet installation,
    - it's to be used within `atclone` and `atpull` ices,
    - it has an optional `--move` option which moves all the files from a subdirectory
      up one level,
    - one other option `--norm` prevents the archive from being deleted upon unpacking.
  - snippets now aren't re-downloaded unless they're newer on the HTTP server; use
    this with the `--norm` option of `ziextract` to prevent unnecessary updates; for
    example, the [firefox-dev package](https://github.com/z-shell/firefox-dev)
    uses this option for this purpose,
  - GitHub doesn't report proper `Last-Modified` HTTP server for the files in the
    repositories so the feature doesn't yet work with such files.

- 11-12-2019

  - Zinit now supports installing special-Zsh NPM packages! Bye-bye the long and
    complex ice-lists! Check out the
    [Wiki](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Zinit-Packages/) for an introductory document
    on the feature.

- 25-11-2019

  - A new subcommand `run` that executes a command in the given plugin's directory. It
    has an `-l` option that will reuse the previously provided plugin. So that it's
    possible to do:

    ```zsh
    zplg run my/plugin ls
    zplg run -l cat \*.plugin.zsh
    zplg run -l pwd
    ```

- 07-11-2019

  - Added a prefix-char: `@` that can be used before plugins if their name collides
    with one of the ice-names. For example `sharkdp/fd` collides with the `sh` ice
    (which causes the plugin to be loaded with the POSIX `sh` emulation applied). To
    load it, do e.g.:

    ```zsh
    zinit as"null" wait"2" lucid from"gh-r" for \
        mv"exa* -> exa" sbin"exa"  ogham/exa \
        mv"fd* -> fd" sbin"fd/fd"  @sharkdp/fd \
        sbin"fzf" junegunn/fzf-bin
    ```

    i.e.: precede the plugin name with `@`. Note: `sbin''` is an ice added by the
    [z-a-bin-gem-node](https://github.com/zinit/z-a-bin-gem-node) annex, it provides
    the command to the command line without altering `$PATH`.

    See the [Zinit Wiki](http://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/For-Syntax/) for more
    information on the for-syntax.

- 06-11-2019

  - A new syntax, called for-syntax. Example:

    ```zsh
     zinit as"program" atload'print Hi!' for \
         atinit'print First!' z-shell/null \
         atinit'print Second!' svn OMZ::plugins/git
    ```

    The output:

    ```sh
    First!
    Hi!
    Second!
    Hi!
    ```

    And also:

    ```zsh
    % print -rl $path | egrep -i '(/git|null)'
    /root/.zinit/snippets/OMZ::plugins/git
    /root/.zinit/plugins/z-shell---null
    ```

    To load in light mode, use a new `light-mode` ice. More examples and information
    can be found on the [Zinit Wiki](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/For-Syntax/).

- 03-11-2019

  - A new value for the `as''` ice — `null`. Specifying `as"null"` is like specifying
    `pick"/dev/null" nocompletions`, i.e.: it disables the sourcing of the default
    script file of a plugin or snippet and also disables the installation of
    completions.

- 30-10-2019

  - A new ice `trigger-load''` — create a function that loads given plugin/snippet,
    with an option (to use it, precede the ice content with `!`) to automatically
    forward the call afterwards. Example use:

    ```zsh
    # Invoking the command `crasis' will load the plugin that
    # provides the function `crasis', and it will be then
    # immediately invoked with the same arguments
    zinit ice trigger-load'!crasis'
    zinit load z-shell/zinit-crasis
    ```

- 22-10-2019

  - A new ice `countdown` — causes an interruptable (by Ctrl-C) countdown 5…4…3…2…1…0
    to be displayed before running the `atclone''`, `atpull''` and `make` ices.

- 21-10-2019

  - The `times` command has a new option `-m` — it shows the **moments** of the plugin
    load times — i.e.: how late after loading Zinit a plugin has been loaded.

- 20-10-2019

  - The `zinit` completion now completes also snippets! The command `snippet`, but
    also `delete`, `recall`, `edit`, `cd`, etc. all receive such completing.
  - The `ice` subcommand can now be skipped — just pass in the ices, e.g.:

    ```zsh
    zinit atload"zicompinit; zicdreplay" blockf
    zinit light zsh-users/zsh-completions
    ```

  - The `compile` command is able to compile snippets.
  - The plugins that add their subdirectories into `$fpath` can be now `blockf`-ed —
    the functions located in the dirs will be correctly auto-loaded.

- 12-10-2019

  - Special value for the `id-as''` ice — `auto`. It sets the plugin/snippet ID
    automatically to the last component of its spec, e.g.:

    ```zsh
    zinit ice id-as"auto"
    zinit load robobenklein/zinc
    ```

    will load the plugin as `id-as'zinc'`.

- 14-09-2019

  - There's a Vim plugin which extends syntax highlighting of zsh scripts with coloring
    of the Zinit commands. [Project
    homepage](https://github.com/zinit/zinit-vim-syntax).

- 13-09-2019

  - New ice `aliases` which loads plugin with the aliases mechanism enabled. Use for
    plugins that define **and use** aliases in their scripts.

- 11-09-2019

  - New ice-mods `sh`,`bash`,`ksh`,`csh` that load plugins (and snippets) with the
    **sticky emulation** feature of Zsh — all functions defined within the plugin will
    automatically switch to the desired emulation mode before executing and switch back
    thereafter. In other words it is now possible to load e.g. bash plugins with
    Zinit, provided that the emulation level done by Zsh is sufficient, e.g.:

    ```zsh
    zinit ice bash pick"bash_it.sh" \
            atinit"BASH_IT=${ZINIT[PLUGINS_DIR]}/Bash-it---bash-it" \
            atclone"yes n | ./install.sh"
    zinit load Bash-it/bash-it
    ```

    This script loads correctly thanks to the emulation, however it isn't functional
    because it uses `type -t …` to check if a function exists.

- 10-09-2019

  - A new ice-mod `reset''` that ivokes `git reset --hard` (or the provided command)
    before `git pull` and `atpull''` ice. It can be used it to implement altering (i.e.
    patching) of the plugin's files inside the `atpull''` ice — `git` will report no
    conflicts when doing `pull`, and the changes can be then again introduced by the
    `atpull''` ice.
  - Three new Zinit annexes (i.e.
    [extensions](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Annexes/)):

    - [z-a-man](https://github.com/zinit/z-a-man)

      Generates man pages and code-documentation man pages from plugin's README.md
      and source files (the code documentation is obtained from
      [Zshelldoc](https://github.com/z-shell/zshelldoc)).

    - [z-a-test](https://github.com/zinit/z-a-test)

      Runs tests (if detected `test` target in a `Makefile` or any `*.zunit` files)
      on plugin installation and non-empty update.

    - [z-a-patch-dl](https://github.com/zinit/z-a-patch-dl)

      Allows easy download and applying of patches, to e.g. aid building a binary
      program equipped in the plugin.

  - A new variable is being recognized by the installation script:
    `$ZPLG_BIN_DIR_NAME`. It configures the directory within `$ZPLG_HOME` to which
    Zinit should be cloned.

</p>
Zinit is a flexible and fast Zshell plugin manager that will allow you to
install everything from GitHub and other sites. Its characteristics are:

1. Zinit is currently the only plugin manager out there that provides Turbo mode
   which yields **50-80% faster Zsh startup** (i.e.: the shell will start up to
   **5** times faster!). Check out a speed comparison with other popular plugin
   managers [here](https://github.com/z-shell/pm-perf-test).

2. The plugin manager gives **reports** from plugin loadings describing what
   **aliases**, functions, **bindkeys**, Zle widgets, zstyles, **completions**,
   variables, `PATH` and `FPATH` elements a plugin has set up. This allows to
   quickly familiarize oneself with a new plugin and provides rich and easy to
   digest information which might be helpful on various occasions.

3. Supported is unloading of plugin and ability to list, (un)install and
   **selectively disable**, **enable** plugin's completions.

4. The plugin manager supports loading Oh My Zsh and Prezto plugins and
   libraries, however the implementation isn't framework specific and doesn't
   bloat the plugin manager with such code (more on this topic can be found on
   the Wiki, in the
   [Introduction](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/INTRODUCTION/#oh_my_zsh_prezto)).

5. The system does not use `$FPATH`, loading multiple plugins doesn't clutter
   `$FPATH` with the same number of entries (e.g. `10`, `15` or more). Code is
   immune to `KSH_ARRAYS` and other options typically causing compatibility
   problems.

6. Zinit supports special, dedicated **packages** that offload the user from
   providing long and complex commands. See the
   [Z-shell](https://github.com/z-shell) organization for a growing,
   complete list of Zinit packages and the [Wiki
   page](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Zinit-Packages/) for an article about
   the feature.

7. Also, specialized Zinit extensions — called **annexes** — allow to extend the
   plugin manager with new commands, URL-preprocessors (used by e.g.:
   [z-a-as-monitor](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-as-monitor) annex),
   post-install and post-update hooks and much more. See the
   [z-shell](https://github.com/z-shell) organization for a growing,
   complete list of available Zinit extensions and refer to the [Wiki
   article](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Annexes/) for an introduction on
   creating your own annex.

## Zinit Wiki

The information in this README is complemented by the [Zinit
Wiki](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/). The README is an introductory overview of
Zinit while the Wiki gives a complete information with examples. Make sure to
read it to get the most out of Zinit.

## Quick Start

## Install

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Zinit is to execute:

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/zinit/main/doc/install.sh)"
```

This will install Zinit in `~/.zinit/bin`.
`.zshrc` will be updated with three lines of code that will be added to the bottom.
The lines will be sourcing `zinit.zsh` and setting up completion for command `zinit`.

After installing and reloading the shell compile Zinit with `zinit self-update`.

### Manual Installation

To manually install Zinit clone the repo to e.g. `~/.zinit/bin`:

```sh
mkdir ~/.zinit
git clone https://github.com/z-shell/zinit.git ~/.zinit/bin
```

and source it from `.zshrc` (above [compinit](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html#Initialization)):

```sh
source ~/.zinit/bin/zinit.zsh
```

If you place the `source` below `compinit`, then add those two lines after the `source`:

```sh
autoload -Uz _zinit
(( ${+_comps} )) && _comps[zinit]=_zinit
```

Various paths can be customized, see section [Customizing Paths](#customizing-paths).

After installing and reloading the shell compile Zinit with `zinit self-update`.

## Usage

### Introduction

[Click here to read the introduction to Zinit](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/INTRODUCTION/). It explains basic usage and some of the more unique features of Zinit such as the Turbo mode. If you're new to Zinit we highly recommend you read it at least once.

### Plugins and snippets

Plugins can be loaded using `load` or `light`.

```zsh
zinit load  <repo/plugin> # Load with reporting/investigating.
zinit light <repo/plugin> # Load without reporting/investigating.
```

If you want to source local or remote files (using direct URL), you can do so with `snippet`.

```zsh
zinit snippet <URL>
```

Such lines should be added to `.zshrc`. Snippets are cached locally, use `-f` option to download
a fresh version of a snippet, or `zinit update {URL}`. Can also use `zinit update --all` to
update all snippets (and plugins).

**Example**

```zsh
# Plugin history-search-multi-word loaded with investigating.
zinit load z-shell/history-search-multi-word

# Two regular plugins loaded without investigating.
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
zinit light z-shell/fast-syntax-highlighting

# Snippet
zinit snippet https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hightemp/5071909/raw/
```

**Prompt(Theme) Example**

This is [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure), [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) sample:

```zsh
# Load powerlevel10k theme
zinit ice depth"1" # git clone depth
zinit light romkatv/powerlevel10k

# Load pure theme
zinit ice pick"async.zsh" src"pure.zsh" # with zsh-async library that's bundled with it.
zinit light sindresorhus/pure

# Load starship theme
zinit ice as"command" from"gh-r" \ # `starship` binary as command, from github release
          atclone"./starship init zsh > init.zsh; ./starship completions zsh > _starship" \ # starship setup at clone(create init.zsh, completion)
          atpull"%atclone" src"init.zsh" # pull behavior same as clone, source init.zsh
zinit light starship/starship
```

### Upgrade Zinit and plugins

Zinit can be updated to `self-update` and plugins to `update`.

```zsh
# Self update
zinit self-update

# Plugin update
zinit update

# Plugin parallel update
zinit update --parallel

# Increase the number of jobs in a concurrent-set to 40
zinit update --parallel 40
```

### Turbo and lucid

Turbo and lucid are the most used options.

<details>
  <summary><b>Turbo Mode</b></summary>
Turbo mode is the key to performance. It can be loaded asynchronously, which makes a huge difference when the amount of plugins increases.

Usually used as `zinit ice wait"<SECONDS>"`, let's use the previous example:

```zsh
zinit ice wait    # wait is same wait"0"
zinit load z-shell/history-search-multi-word

zinit ice wait"2" # load after 2 seconds
zinit load z-shell/history-search-multi-word

zinit ice wait    # also be used in `light` and `snippet`
zinit snippet https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hightemp/5071909/raw/
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Lucid</b></summary>

Turbo mode is verbose, so you need an option for quiet.

You can use with `lucid`:

```zsh
zinit ice wait lucid
zinit load z-shell/history-search-multi-word
```

</details>

**_F&A:_** What is `ice`?

`ice` is zinit's option command. The option melts like ice and is used only once.
(more: [Ice Modifiers](#ice-modifiers))

### Migration

<details>
  <summary><b>Migration from Oh-My-ZSH</b></summary>

**Basic**

```zsh
zinit snippet <URL>        # Raw Syntax with URL
zinit snippet OMZ::<PATH>  # Shorthand OMZ/ (http://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/raw/master/)
zinit snippet OMZL::<PATH> # Shorthand OMZ/lib/
zinit snippet OMZT::<PATH> # Shorthand OMZ/themes/
zinit snippet OMZP::<PATH> # Shorthand OMZ/plugins/
```

**Library**

Importing the [clipboard](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/clipboard.zsh) and [termsupport](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/termsupport.zsh) Oh-My-Zsh Library Sample:

```zsh
# Raw Syntax
zinit snippet https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/clipboard.zsh
zinit snippet https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/termsupport.zsh

# OMZ Shorthand Syntax
zinit snippet OMZ::lib/clipboard.zsh
zinit snippet OMZ::lib/termsupport.zsh

# OMZL Shorthand Syntax
zinit snippet OMZL::clipboard.zsh
zinit snippet OMZL::termsupport.zsh
```

**Theme**

To use **themes** created for Oh My Zsh you might want to first source the `git` library there.

Then you can use the themes as snippets (`zinit snippet <file path or GitHub URL>`).
Some themes require not only Oh My Zsh's Git **library**, but also Git **plugin** (error
about `current_branch` may appear). Load this Git-plugin as single-file
snippet directly from OMZ.

Most themes require `promptsubst` option (`setopt promptsubst` in `zshrc`), if it isn't set, then
prompt will appear as something like: `... $(build_prompt) ...`.

You might want to suppress completions provided by the git plugin by issuing `zinit cdclear -q`
(`-q` is for quiet) – see below **Ignoring Compdefs**.

To summarize:

```zsh
## Oh My Zsh Setting
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"

## Zinit Setting
# Must Load OMZ Git library
zinit snippet OMZL::git.zsh

# Load Git plugin from OMZ
zinit snippet OMZP::git
zinit cdclear -q # <- forget completions provided up to this moment

setopt promptsubst

# Load Prompt
zinit snippet OMZT::robbyrussell
```

External Theme Sample: [NicoSantangelo/Alpharized](https://github.com/nicosantangelo/Alpharized)

```zsh
## Oh My Zsh Setting
ZSH_THEME="alpharized"

## Zinit Setting
# Must Load OMZ Git library

zinit snippet OMZL::git.zsh

# Load Git plugin from OMZ
zinit snippet OMZP::git
zinit cdclear -q # <- forget completions provided up to this moment

setopt promptsubst

# Load Prompt
zinit light NicoSantangelo/Alpharized
```

**_F&A:_** Error occurs when loading OMZ's theme.

If the `git` library will not be loaded, then similar to following errors will be appearing:

```zsh
........:1: command not found: git_prompt_status
........:1: command not found: git_prompt_short_sha
```

**Plugin**

If it consists of a single file, you can just load it.

```zsh
## Oh-My-Zsh Setting
plugins=(
  git
  dotenv
  rake
  rbenv
  ruby
)

## Zinit Setting
zinit snippet OMZP::git
zinit snippet OMZP::dotenv
zinit snippet OMZP::rake
zinit snippet OMZP::rbenv
zinit snippet OMZP::ruby
```

Use `zinit ice svn` if multiple files require an entire subdirectory.
Like [gitfast](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/gitfast), [osx](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/osx):

```zsh
zinit ice svn
zinit snippet OMZP::gitfast

zinit ice svn
zinit snippet OMZP::osx
```

Use `zinit ice as"completion"` to directly add single file completion snippets.
Like [docker](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/docker), [fd](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/fd):

```zsh
zinit ice as"completion"
zinit snippet OMZP::docker/_docker

zinit ice as"completion"
zinit snippet OMZP::fd/_fd
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Migration from Prezto</b></summary>

**Basic**

```shell
zinit snippet <URL>        # Raw Syntax with URL
zinit snippet PZT::<PATH>  # Shorthand PZT/ (https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/)
zinit snippet PZTM::<PATH> # Shorthand PZT/modules/
```

**Modules**

Importing the [environment](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/environment) and [terminal](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/terminal) Prezto Modules Sample:

```zsh
## Prezto Setting
zstyle ':prezto:load' pmodule 'environment' 'terminal'

## Zinit Setting
# Raw Syntax
zinit snippet https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/master/modules/environment/init.zsh
zinit snippet https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/blob/master/modules/terminal/init.zsh

# PZT Shorthand Syntax
zinit snippet PZT::modules/environment
zinit snippet PZT::modules/terminal

# PZTM Shorthand Syntax
zinit snippet PZTM::environment
zinit snippet PZTM::terminal
```

Use `zinit ice svn` if multiple files require an entire subdirectory.
Like [docker](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/docker), [git](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/git):

```zsh
zinit ice svn
zinit snippet PZTM::docker

zinit ice svn
zinit snippet PZTM::git
```

Use `zinit ice as"null"` if don't exist `*.plugin.zsh`, `init.zsh`, `*.zsh-theme*` files in module.
Like [archive](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/archive):

```zsh
zinit ice svn as"null"
zinit snippet PZTM::archive
```

Use `zinit ice atclone"git clone <repo> <location>"` if module have external module.
Like [completion](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/completion):

```shell
zplugin ice svn blockf \ # use blockf to prevent any unnecessary additions to fpath, as zinit manages fpath
            atclone"git clone --recursive https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git external"
zplugin snippet PZTM::completion
```

**_F&A:_** What is `zstyle`?

Read [zstyle](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzutil-Module) doc (more: [What does `zstyle` do?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/214657/what-does-zstyle-do)).

### More Examples

After installing Zinit you can start adding some actions (load some plugins) to `~/.zshrc`, at bottom. Some examples:

```zsh
# Load the pure theme, with zsh-async library that's bundled with it.
zinit ice pick"async.zsh" src"pure.zsh"
zinit light sindresorhus/pure

# A glance at the new for-syntax – load all of the above
# plugins with a single command. For more information see:
# https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/For-Syntax/
zinit for \
    light-mode  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions \
    light-mode  z-shell/fast-syntax-highlighting \
                z-shell/history-search-multi-word \
    light-mode pick"async.zsh" src"pure.zsh" \
                sindresorhus/pure

# Binary release in archive, from GitHub-releases page.
# After automatic unpacking it provides program "fzf".
zinit ice from"gh-r" as"program"
zinit light junegunn/fzf

# One other binary release, it needs renaming from `docker-compose-Linux-x86_64`.
# This is done by ice-mod `mv'{from} -> {to}'. There are multiple packages per
# single version, for OS X, Linux and Windows – so ice-mod `bpick' is used to
# select Linux package – in this case this is actually not needed, Zinit will
# grep operating system name and architecture automatically when there's no `bpick'.
zinit ice from"gh-r" as"program" mv"docker* -> docker-compose" bpick"*linux*"
zinit load docker/compose

# Vim repository on GitHub – a typical source code that needs compilation – Zinit
# can manage it for you if you like, run `./configure` and other `make`, etc. stuff.
# Ice-mod `pick` selects a binary program to add to $PATH. You could also install the
# package under the path $ZPFX, see: http://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Compiling-programs
zinit ice as"program" atclone"rm -f src/auto/config.cache; ./configure" \
    atpull"%atclone" make pick"src/vim"
zinit light vim/vim

# Scripts that are built at install (there's single default make target, "install",
# and it constructs scripts by `cat'ing a few files). The make'' ice could also be:
# `make"install PREFIX=$ZPFX"`, if "install" wouldn't be the only, default target.
zinit ice as"program" pick"$ZPFX/bin/git-*" make"PREFIX=$ZPFX"
zinit light tj/git-extras

# Handle completions without loading any plugin, see "clist" command.
# This one is to be ran just once, in interactive session.
zinit creinstall %HOME/my_completions
```

```zsh
# For GNU ls (the binaries can be gls, gdircolors, e.g. on OS X when installing the
# coreutils package from Homebrew; you can also use https://github.com/ogham/exa)
zinit ice atclone"dircolors -b LS_COLORS > c.zsh" atpull'%atclone' pick"c.zsh" nocompile'!'
zinit light trapd00r/LS_COLORS
```

[You can see an extended explanation of LS_COLORS in the Wiki.](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/LS_COLORS-explanation/)

```zsh
# make'!...' -> run make before atclone & atpull
zinit ice as"program" make'!' atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' atpull'%atclone' src"zhook.zsh"
zinit light direnv/direnv
```

[You can see an extended explanation of direnv in the Wiki.](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Direnv-explanation/)

Also, two articles on the Wiki present an example setup
[here](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Example-Minimal-Setup/) and
[here](https://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Example-Oh-My-Zsh-setup/).

## How to Use

### Ice Modifiers

Following `ice` modifiers are to be
[passed](http://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/Alternate-Ice-Syntax/) to `zinit ice ...` to
obtain described effects. The word `ice` means something that's added (like ice to a
drink) – and in Zinit it means adding modifier to a next `zinit` command, and also
something that's temporary because it melts – and this means that the modification will
last only for a **single** next `zinit` command.

Some Ice-modifiers are highlighted and clicking on them will take you to the
appropriate Wiki page for an extended explanation.

You may safely assume a given ice works with both plugins and snippets unless
explicitly stated otherwise.

| [**`wrap-track`**](http://z-shell.github.io/zinit/wiki/wrap-track) | <div align="justify" style='text-align: justify;'> Takes a `;`-separated list of function names that are to be investigated (meaning gathering report and unload data) **once** during execution. It works by wrapping the functions with a investigating-enabling and disabling snippet of code. In summary, `wrap-track` allows to extend the investigating beyond the moment of loading of a plugin. Example use is to `wrap-track` a precmd function of a prompt (like `_p9k_precmd()` of powerlevel10k) or other plugin that _postpones its initialization till the first prompt_ (like e.g.: zsh-autosuggestions). **Does not work with snippets.**</div>                                                           |

If no such files will be found, then it extracts all found files of known **type** – the type is being read by the `file` Unix command. If not empty, then takes names of the files to extract.

### Updating Zinit and Plugins

To update Zinit issue `zinit self-update` in the command line.

To update all plugins and snippets, issue `zinit update`. If you wish to update only
a single plugin/snippet instead issue `zinit update NAME_OF_PLUGIN`. A list of
commits will be shown:

<p align="center">
<img src="./doc/img/update.png" />
</p>

Some plugins require performing an action each time they're updated. One way you can do
this is by using the `atpull` ice modifier. For example, writing `zinit ice atpull'./configure'` before loading a plugin will execute `./configure` after a successful update. Refer to [Ice Modifiers](#ice-modifiers) for more information.

The ice modifiers for any plugin or snippet are stored in their directory in a
`._zinit` subdirectory, hence the plugin doesn't have to be loaded to be correctly
updated. There's one other file created there, `.zinit_lstupd` – it holds the log of
the new commits pulled-in in the last update.

### Calling `compinit` Without Turbo Mode

With no Turbo mode in use, compinit can be called normally, i.e.: as `autoload compinit; compinit`. This should be done after loading of all plugins and before possibly calling
`zinit cdreplay`.

The `cdreplay` subcommand is provided to re-play all catched `compdef` calls. The
`compdef` calls are used to define a completion for a command. For example, `compdef _git git` defines that the `git` command should be completed by a `_git` function.

The `compdef` function is provided by `compinit` call. As it should be called later,
after loading all of the plugins, Zinit provides its own `compdef` function that
catches (i.e.: records in an array) the arguments of the call, so that the loaded
plugins can freely call `compdef`. Then, the `cdreplay` (_compdef-replay_) can be used,
after `compinit` will be called (and the original `compdef` function will become
available), to execute all detected `compdef` calls. To summarize:

```sh
source ~/.zinit/bin/zinit.zsh

zinit load "some/plugin"
...
compdef _gnu_generic fd  # this will be intercepted by Zinit, because as the compinit
                         # isn't yet loaded, thus there's no such function `compdef'; yet
                         # Zinit provides its own `compdef' function which saves the
                         # completion-definition for later possible re-run with `zinit
                         # cdreplay' or `zicdreplay' (the second one can be used in hooks
                         # like atload'', atinit'', etc.)
...
zinit load "other/plugin"

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit

zinit cdreplay -q   # -q is for quiet; actually run all the `compdef's saved before
                    #`compinit` call (`compinit' declares the `compdef' function, so
                    # it cannot be used until `compinit' is ran; Zinit solves this
                    # via intercepting the `compdef'-calls and storing them for later
                    # use with `zinit cdreplay')
```

This allows to call compinit once.
Performance gains are huge, example shell startup time with double `compinit`: **0.980** sec, with
`cdreplay` and single `compinit`: **0.156** sec.

### Calling `compinit` With Turbo Mode

If you load completions using `wait''` Turbo mode then you can add
`atinit'zicompinit'` to syntax-highlighting plugin (which should be the last
one loaded, as their (2 projects, [z-sy-h](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) &
[f-sy-h](https://github.com/z-shell/fast-syntax-highlighting))
documentation state), or `atload'zicompinit'` to last
completion-related plugin. `zicompinit` is a function that just runs `autoload compinit; compinit`, created for convenience. There's also `zicdreplay` which
will replay any caught compdefs so you can also do: `atinit'zicompinit; zicdreplay'`, etc. Basically, the whole topic is the same as normal `compinit` call,
but it is done in `atinit` or `atload` hook of the last related plugin with use of the
helper functions (`zicompinit`,`zicdreplay` & `zicdclear` – see below for explanation
of the last one). To summarize:

```zsh
source ~/.zinit/bin/zinit.zsh

# Load using the for-syntax
zinit wait lucid for \
    "some/plugin"
zinit wait lucid for \
    "other/plugin"

zinit wait lucid atload"zicompinit; zicdreplay" blockf for \
    zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

### Ignoring Compdefs

If you want to ignore compdefs provided by some plugins or snippets, place their load commands
before commands loading other plugins or snippets, and issue `zinit cdclear` (or
`zicdclear`, designed to be used in hooks like `atload''`):

```SystemVerilog
source ~/.zinit/bin/zinit.zsh
zinit snippet OMZP::git
zinit cdclear -q # <- forget completions provided by Git plugin

zinit load "some/plugin"
...
zinit load "other/plugin"

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
zinit cdreplay -q # <- execute compdefs provided by rest of plugins
zinit cdlist # look at gathered compdefs
```

The `cdreplay` is important if you use plugins like
`OMZP::kubectl` or `asdf-vm/asdf`, because these plugins call
`compdef`.

### Disabling System-Wide `compinit` Call (Ubuntu)

On Ubuntu users might get surprised that e.g. their completions work while they didn't
call `compinit` in their `.zshrc`. That's because the function is being called in
`/etc/zshrc`. To disable this call – what is needed to avoid the slowdown and if user
loads any completion-equipped plugins, i.e. almost on 100% – add the following lines to
`~/.zshenv`:

```zsh
# Skip the not really helping Ubuntu global compinit
skip_global_compinit=1
```

## Zinit Module

### Motivation

The module is a binary Zsh module (think about `zmodload` Zsh command, it's that topic) which transparently and
automatically **compiles sourced scripts**. Many plugin managers do not offer compilation of plugins, the module is
a solution to this. Even if a plugin manager does compile plugin's main script (like Zinit does), the script can
source smaller helper scripts or dependency libraries (for example, the prompt `geometry-zsh/geometry` does that)
and there are very few solutions to that, which are demanding (e.g. specifying all helper files in plugin load
command and investigating updates to the plugin – in Zinit case: by using `compile` ice-mod).

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/zinit/images/mod-auto-compile.png)

### Installation

#### Without Zinit

To install just the binary Zinit module **standalone** (Zinit is not needed, the module can be used with any
other plugin manager), execute:

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/zinit/main/doc/mod-install.sh)"
```

This script will display what to add to `~/.zshrc` (2 lines) and show usage instructions.

#### With Zinit

Zinit users can build the module by issuing following command instead of running above `mod-install.sh` script
(the script is for e.g. `zgen` users or users of any other plugin manager):

```zsh
zinit module build
```

This command will compile the module and display instructions on what to add to `~/.zshrc`.

### Measuring Time of `source`s

Besides the compilation-feature, the module also measures **duration** of each script sourcing. Issue `zpmod source-study` after loading the module at top of `~/.zshrc` to see a list of all sourced files with the time the
sourcing took in milliseconds on the left. This feature allows to profile the shell startup. Also, no script can
pass-through that check and you will obtain a complete list of all loaded scripts, like if Zshell itself was
investigating this. The list can be surprising.

### Debugging

To enable debug messages from the module set:

```zsh
typeset -g ZPLG_MOD_DEBUG=1
```

## Hints and Tips

### Customizing Paths

Following variables can be set to custom values, before sourcing Zinit. The
previous global variables like `$ZPLG_HOME` have been removed to not pollute
the namespace – there's single `$ZINIT` hash instead of `8` string
variables. Please update your dotfiles.

```
declare -A ZINIT  # initial Zinit's hash definition, if configuring before loading Zinit, and then:
```

This option can give a performance gain of about 10 ms out of 150 ms (i.e.: Zsh will start up in 140 ms instead of 150 ms). |

There is also `$ZPFX`, set by default to `~/.zinit/polaris` – a directory
where software with `Makefile`, etc. can be pointed to, by e.g. `atclone'./configure --prefix=$ZPFX'`.

### Non-GitHub (Local) Plugins

Use `create` subcommand with user name `_local` (the default) to create plugin's
skeleton in `$ZINIT[PLUGINS_DIR]`. It will be not connected with GitHub repository
(because of user name being `_local`). To enter the plugin's directory use `cd` command
with just plugin's name (without `_local`, it's optional).

If user name will not be `_local`, then Zinit will create repository also on GitHub
and setup correct repository origin.

### Extending Git

There are several projects that provide git extensions. Installing them with
Zinit has many benefits:

- all files are under `$HOME` – no administrator rights needed,
- declarative setup (like Chef or Puppet) – copying `.zshrc` to different account
  brings also git-related setup,
- easy update by e.g. `zinit update --all`.

Below is a configuration that adds multiple git extensions, loaded in Turbo mode,
1 second after prompt, with use of the
[Bin-Gem-Node](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node) annex:

```zsh
zinit as"null" wait"1" lucid for \
    sbin    Fakerr/git-recall \
    sbin    cloneopts paulirish/git-open \
    sbin    paulirish/git-recent \
    sbin    davidosomething/git-my \
    sbin atload"export _MENU_THEME=legacy" \
            arzzen/git-quick-stats \
    sbin    iwata/git-now \
    make"PREFIX=$ZPFX install" \
            tj/git-extras \
    sbin"bin/git-dsf;bin/diff-so-fancy" \
            z-shell/zsh-diff-so-fancy \
    sbin"git-url;git-guclone" make"GITURL_NO_CGITURL=1" \
            z-shell/git-url
```

Target directory for installed files is `$ZPFX` (`~/.zinit/polaris` by default).
